This project also incoporated several best practice for material design such as :- login to signup and Launch Screen/App Loading Screen as Spalsh Screen (eliminate unnessary waiting time for user) 
This project also includes test codes for instrumental and unit testing. Code coverage is at 100% for all classes. 
This project uses the following technologies:-
